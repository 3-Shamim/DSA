* Time complexity
  * Notation
    * Big Oh
      * Maximum possible complexity
    * Big Omega
      * Minimum possible complexity
    * Big Theta
      * Possible complexity between MIN - MAX. (Range)
    * Little Oh
    * Little Omega
* Space complexity
  * Auxiliary space (That takes extra space, constant space will be ignored)
